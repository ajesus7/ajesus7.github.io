            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>The Espresso Society</p>
            
            <p>The Espresso Society is a coffee shop dedicated to creating a soothing work and study environment while serving high quality coffee. </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target audience are younger adults who are in need of a place to study or complete their work for the day. The coffee will be upscale and more expensive so the 
                target consumer will need to be able to spend a bit more money on the coffee. They may be anywhere between 20 and 50 years old, but that doesn't mean people under or over that
            age wouldn't enjoy the shop. </p>
           
            <p>The goals of the customers are to be productive and work in an environment that enhances their efficiency. They want to accomplish their tasks early in the day so that they can go
                out and do what they love. They want to feel powerful and be productive.</p>

					<h1> About us </h1>

                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
					<p> Kreuzberg California opened its doors in downtown San Luis Obispo in 2010 as an experiment in combining the vibrant cafe
                    scene of the Kreuzberg neighborhood of Berlin, with the chill breezy lifestyle of San Luis Obispo. The idea was to
                    create a place where you could grab a cappuccino in the morning, a sando at lunch, and then close up your laptop for
                    cocktails with friends at night. We love our community.
                    
                    Come be creative with us.  </p>
