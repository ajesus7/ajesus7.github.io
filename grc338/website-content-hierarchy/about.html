                <h3>Our Story</h3>

                <p> The Espresso Society first came to be in 2015 when we opened our first store in San Luis Obispo. We have since opened stores in Portland, Seattle,
                    and Orange County California. The idea was to create a place where you could show up early in the morning and get some solid, concentrated work done. We
                    wanted to create an environment with no distractions that allowed our customers to become the best and most productive versions of themselves. 
                    Increase your productivity with us. And have a damn good cup of coffee along the way.  </p>
